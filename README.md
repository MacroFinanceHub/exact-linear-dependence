# Exact Inference of Linear Dependence
Copyright (C) 2020 Oliver Cliff.

This repository provides MATLAB functions for the exact inference of linear dependence between multiple autocorrelated time series. This includes various linear-dependence measures and the hypothesis tests for inferring their significance, all discussed in the paper found here:

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03887](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03887)

The measures implemented are: **mutual information**, **conditional mutual information**, **Granger causality**, and **conditional Granger causality** (each for *univariate* and *multivariate* linear-Gaussian processes). For completeness we have also included **Pearson correlation** and **partial correlation** for *univariate* processes (with a potentially *multivariate* conditional process).

# Getting started
1. Ensure you have MATLAB's [Econometrics Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/econometrics.html) and [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html) downloaded and installed (for the autocorrelation and filtering functions).
2. Clone (or download) the repository.
2. Documentation found in help for each function. The main functions used are *mvmi.m* (**multivariate mutual information**), *mvgc.m* (**multivariate Granger causality**), and *pcorr.m* (**Pearson correlation**). All three allow adding a conditional process and can optionally output a *p*-value by using the *significance.m* function. The *p*-values are either generated from the standard/asymptotic tests (i.e., the **likelihood-ratio tests** and **Student's t-test**), or the **exact tests** we derive in our paper.
3. Demos are included in the *demos* subfolder, including all experiments from the paper. Start with *demos/numerical_evaluation.m* or *demos/hcp_case_study.m* to see all the results from the paper. As an example of Bartlett-correcting hypothesis tests for **Pearson correlation**, we have also included a demo on inferring cross-correlations between *univariate* autocorrelated processes in *demos/crosscorr_example.m*.
